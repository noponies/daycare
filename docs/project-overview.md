# Daycare
Daycare's softness and scale speak of pre-school children ritualistic practicing of their names each morning. Their large irregular glyphs drawn with inconsistent consistency peeking through, habits good and bad forming. Uniquely rendered, each child's names test the bounds of adult legibility. With time tempering the flourishes as each child learns to conform to the formal restrictions of the alphabet and standardised communication. Over the duration of a year, letter spacing slowly gets more regular, scales reduce and control increases. With school looming, arms learn to rest on paper and fingers learn to hold pens the 'correct' way.

Daycare attempts to capture a father's emotions, a child's long journey away from his parents, a series of shared experiences, group typographic gestation, a location and a period of time, now past.

Daycare is drawn as a deeply personal artefact.

### Formal language
Formally Daycare is without angles, or repetition of rigid typographic unit based form. Rather Daycare is soft, fluffy and imprecise within the bounds of a 1000em unit block. With consistency present in the design language employed across the entire glyph set.

Daycare is primarily intended as a display face where scale affords more leeway for legibility.

Daycare supports the full Western European and Central European character sets.
